Sinter is an HTML5 implementation of affine-projective steiner triple
system card games.  These are card games in which you are trying to
find card triples which satisfy a simple rule.  These games also have
the property that for any two cards there is a unique third card that
completes the triple.  The triples in these games also satisfy a
certain technical symmetric property, and are the only steiner triple
system card games that do so.

These card games exist for all card deck sizes of the form
Product(2^i - 1)
where the i's are positive integers (not necessarily distinct).
The popular Set brand card game has i's = 2,2,2,2.

Sinter currently supports all 17 non-trivial deck sizes under 256:
7,9,15,21,27,31,45,63,81,93,105,127,135,189,217,243,255

105 3,4   7
127 7     7

189 2^3,3 9
217 3,5   8
243 2^5   10
255 8     8

All have 5 or fewer property-sets with 8 or fewer bits each,
and 10 or fewer total bits per card.
